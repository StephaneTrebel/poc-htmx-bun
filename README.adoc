= About

This repository is a simple proof of concept around https://htmx.org[HTMX], and since it can be linked to an HTTP backend, I chose https://bun.sh/[Bun].

Stack:
- Bun for the JavaScript engine
- Fastify for the web server
- HTMX for that sweet HyperText overdrive
- Andâ€¦that's it !

= Objectives

- Show how HTMX can be handled with a Typescript first backend
- Have fun !
